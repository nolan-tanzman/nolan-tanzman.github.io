    DO cover your face with a couple layers of cloth while in public places.<br><br>DO wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before you put your mask on and after you take it off.<br><br>DO wash your cloth face covering in a washing machine after a day’s use.<br><br>DO take a cloth face covering with you if you are hiking or visiting a park. Although you do not need to wear one outside, you may find that you need to come within 6 feet of someone else on a trail. At that point, put your cloth face covering on, say hello, and carry on.<br><br>DO make sure the cloth face covering covers both your mouth and nose.

    <em><strong>Additional we have gathered some other useful information from trusted sources regarding what not to do with your mask.</strong></em>
  </p>

  <p class="msg msg--warning">
    DON’T wear surgical-grade masks or N95 respirators. We need to reserve those for health care and other frontline workers.
<br>DON’T think that wearing cloth face masks means we can gather in large groups of people. For most of the state, all gatherings are prohibited. For the counties that are in Phase 2, all gatherings of more than 5 people outside your household are prohibited.
<br>DON’T think that wearing a cloth face mask makes it safe to come within six feet of other people. At best, a cloth face covering is just one added level of precaution. It doesn’t really help unless we are also washing our hands, staying home when we are sick, and practicing physical distancing.
<br>DON’T wear a cloth face covering while exercising outdoors. It’s not dangerous, just annoying and not necessary.
<br>DON’T put a cloth face covering on a child under age 2 or on a person with a disability that keeps them from being able to remove it.
<br>DON’T touch your cloth face covering after you put it on. Try not to touch your face at all.
<br>DON’T worry that a cloth face covering might restrict your oxygen. It’s not airtight. If you ever feel like you’re having trouble breathing, remove the cloth face covering and sit down. If the feeling persists, call 911.

<div class="post">
<p>The Washington State Department of Health is closely monitoring progress toward development of a vaccine for COVID-19. We are engaged in vaccine planning efforts and we will be ready to distribute a safe and effective vaccine as soon as the time comes. However, all vaccine candidates are still in clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy.</p>
<p>DOH’s position is that any COVID-19 vaccine should complete Phase 3 trials before being distributed, unless an independent board of scientists reviewing the data finds otherwise based on data from those trials. At this crucial juncture, it is incumbent upon the federal government to critically evaluate these new vaccines for their safety and efficacy in an unbiased way.</p>
<p>In the meantime, DOH will continue working with federal and local partners to build the infrastructure needed for distribution. When a vaccine is ready, we will be prepared to deploy it in a manner ensure that is equitable, safe and timely for the people of Washington.</p>
